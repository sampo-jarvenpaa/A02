PART 2:

Branch: A version of a **repository**, which has diverged from another version at some point, hence the name "**branch**". **Branches** can be thought of as parallel versions to each other, which are usually made to test out experimental features or alternate implementations.

Clone: A command to duplicate a **GIT** **repositiry**, often used to get a copy of a **remote** **repository** from the web (e.g. **Github**) to a local machine.

Commit: A command that creates a copy of changes made to a **repository** on the local machine. Changes must be **pushed** to be applied to the **remote** **repository**.

Fetch: Gets the changes made to the **remote** **repository** from it. Changes can then be merged into the local **repository**.

GIT: A popular version control system.

Github: A web service designed specifically for storing **remote** **GIT** **repositories**.

Merge: A command used to combine the changes from two differing versions of a **repository** into one of them.

Merge Conflict: A conflict that arises when one attempts to **merge** two **repository** versions that both modify the same data in different ways.

Push: Moves the local changes in the form of **commits** to the **remote** **repository**.

Pull: Gets the changes made to the **remote** **repository** from it and automatically merges them into the local **repository**.

Remote: A **repository** that is stored somewhere in the web instead of on the user's local machine.

Repository: A digital database (e.g. a folder), serving as the base of what version control is for in the first place.
