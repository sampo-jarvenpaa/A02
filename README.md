PART 1:

Assuming you're a Windows user, start by installing Git from https://git-scm.com/downloads. Follow the install instructions given on the page. After that, download and install WebStorm from https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/. If you don't have a license for it, you can get a student license from https://www.jetbrains.com/community/education/#students, by following the instructions and applying for the license with your student email. Once you have downloaded WebStorm, install it by once again following the install instructions. Open it once installed and create a new project. Next, create a GitHub account on https://github.com/. Follow the instructinos given on the page. Once you have an account, create a new repository using the "New" button at the top left. Give your repository a name and set the settings to your preference. Go back to WebStorm, and from the top bar, click on the branch icon to open the version control menu. Connect your WebStorm to your recently created GitHub account from the menu. It will prompt you to accept connecting the account, both from GitHub's, and from WebStorm's side. Go back to webstorm, and make some edits to your progress. From the same version control menu, commit your changes using the "Commit" button. Once committed, using the "Push" button in the same menu, push those changes to GitHub. When doing so for the first time, it will ask you for the repository you want to push your chages to. Choose the repository you created earlier. From now on you only have to commit and push, and the changes will be moved to the same repository automatically, when pushed.

PART 2:

Branch: A version of a **repository**, which has diverged from another version at some point, hence the name "**branch**". **Branches** can be thought of as parallel versions to each other, which are usually made to test out experimental features or alternate implementations.

Clone: A command to duplicate a **GIT** **repositiry**, often used to get a copy of a **remote** **repository** from the web (e.g. **Github**) to a local machine.

Commit: A command that creates a copy of changes made to a **repository** on the local machine. Changes must be **pushed** to be applied to the **remote** **repository**.

Fetch: Gets the changes made to the **remote** **repository** from it. Changes can then be merged into the local **repository**.

GIT: A popular version control system.

Github: A web service designed specifically for storing **remote** **GIT** **repositories**.

Merge: A command used to combine the changes from two differing versions of a **repository** into one of them.

Merge Conflict: A conflict that arises when one attempts to **merge** two **repository** versions that both modify the same data in different ways.

Push: Moves the local changes in the form of **commits** to the **remote** **repository**.

Pull: Gets the changes made to the **remote** **repository** from it and automatically merges them into the local **repository**.

Remote: A **repository** that is stored somewhere in the web instead of on the user's local machine.

Repository: A digital database (e.g. a folder), serving as the base of what version control is for in the first place.
